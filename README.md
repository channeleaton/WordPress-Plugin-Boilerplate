# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate (Extended)

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate (Extended) is based on [Tom McFarlin's](http://http://tommcfarlin.com/) [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate). In addition to the great standards that it introduces, the extended version includes some extra goodies for developers such as Grunt, Coffeescript, Compass and others.

## Features

* The Plugin Boilerplate is fully-based on the WordPress [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API)
* Uses [PHPDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) conventions for easily following the code
* Liberal use of `@todo` to guide you through what you need to change
* Uses a strict file organization scheme to make sure the assets are easily maintainable
* Grunt tasks to help you process Coffeescript and Compass
* Uses the [WordPress Settings Framework](https://github.com/gilbitron/WordPress-Settings-Framework) to make plugin settings simple as pie.
* Meta boxes and fields are easier than ever to create with [Custom Metaboxes and Fields](https://github.com/jaredatch/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress)
* Plugin can update directly from GitHub with the [WordPress GitHub Plugin Updater](https://github.com/jkudish/WordPress-GitHub-Plugin-Updater)

## System Requirements

* [Node][10]
* [NPM][11]
* [CoffeeScript][12]
* [Grunt][13]
* [Ruby][14]
* [Ruby Gems][15]
* [Compass][16]
 
## Installation and Use

1. Clone this repo to the desired location.
2. In your terminal, navigate to the plugin location `cd /path/to/the/plugin`
3. Run `npm install` to set up the grunt modules
4. Run `grep -rn '@todo' .` to find all of the `@todo` locations. Edit the todo items as instructed.
5. Run `grunt watch` and edit to your heart's content. Grunt will automatically compile your Coffeescript and Compass files to the correct location.
 
*NOTE:* If you add Compass or Coffeescript files, be sure to add them to the `Gruntfile` as well as the main plugin file.
